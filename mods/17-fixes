Various changes/fixes.

Some changes for compatibility with various packages, allowing
more access to internals.

Fixes the following bug:

  f <- function (a) 
  { 
    x <- a
  
    function () { b <- a; b[2]<-1000; a+b  }
  }
  
  g <- f(c(7,8,9))
  
  save.image("tmpimage")
  load("tmpimage")
  
  print(g())
  
where the result printed was 14 2000 18 rather than 14 1008 18.

Fixes bug in prod with integer vector containing NA, eg prod(NA).

Cleaned up code in R_AllocStringBuffer, avoiding potential segfault.

Fixed lack-of-protection bug in mkCharLenCE (showed up in checks for
package cmrutils), other improvements in CHARSXP hashing stuff, made
R_StringHash local to memory.c.

Fixed a problem with xtfrm demonstrated by the following (and
affecting package "lsr"):

  f<-function(...) xtfrm(...); f(c(1,3,2))

Also made related change to "range" to probably make it more robust
(though no actual bad behaviour is apparent).

Fixed bug in maintaining NAMEDCNT when assigning to a variable in
an environment using $ (showed up in check of package 'plus').
