Miscellaneous cleanups/optimizations, including:

Fixed glitch that would prevent pipelining into MODOP.

Fixed NAMEDCNT bug in assignment of repeated elements to a list array;
added tests for such cases.

Fixed ifelse bug introduced earlier in pqR, and sped it up a bit more.
Also put in S4 check from R-3.0.0.
