Further improvements in the reference BLAS routines.  Also slight
improvements in array.c in code using BLAS.

DSYRK improved, which affects performance of R crossprod and tcrossprod.

DGEMM improved for the case where the first operand is transposed, and
for the case where both operands are transposed.

Also fixes the bug illustrate below:

  a <- matrix(c(NA,1,0,1),2,2,byrow=T)
  print(a%*%t(a))
  print(tcrossprod(a,a))
  print(tcrossprod(a))
