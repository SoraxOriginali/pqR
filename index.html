<h1>pqR - a pretty quick version of R</h1>

<P>pqR is a new version of the R interpreter.  It is based on
R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team (at <a
href="http://r-project.org">r-project.org</a>), but improves on it in
many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by implementing some
new features and fixing some bugs.

<P>One notable improvement is that pqR is able to do some numeric
computations in parallel with each other, and with other operations of
the interpreter, on systems with multiple processors or processor
cores.

<P>For a list of new features in the current release of
2013-07-19, see the <a href="NEWS.txt">NEWS file<a>.

<P>To install pqR on a Linux/Unix system, download <A
HREF="http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/archive/2013-07-19.tar.gz">this
gzipped tar file</a> and unpack it with the "tar" command.
Configuration, compilations, and installation can then be done in the
same way as for R-2.15.0 (see <a href="INSTALL.txt">here</a>), but
there are some additional options for pqR, explained in the <a
href="NEWS.txt">NEWS file</a>.

<P>Installation on a Mac system is recommended only for those who are
experienced in installing R from source.  See the NEWS file for some
information.  Trying to install pqR on a Windows system is not
currently recommended (some success on Windows has been reported, but
tweaks are required that aren't yet all in the current version).

<P>For more information, see the following manuals (in HTML or PDF format):
<ul>
<li> <a href="R-intro.html">Introduction to R</a> (or as
     <a href="R-intro.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> <a href="R-admin.html">R Installation and Administration</a> (or as
     <a href="R-admin.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> <a href="R-data.html">R Data Import/Export</a> (or as
     <a href="R-data.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> <a href="R-exts.html">Writing R Extensions</a> (or as
     <a href="R-exts.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> <a href="R-ints.html">R Internals</a> (or as
     <a href="R-ints.pdf">PDF</a>).
<li> <a href="R-lang.html">R Language Definition (DRAFT)</a> (or as
     <a href="R-lang.pdf">PDF</a>).
</ul>
There is also a <a href="R-FAQ.html">FAQ</a> (or as <a
href="R-FAQ.pdf">PDF</a>), which has not been updated for pqR.

<P>Further information (eg, systems on which pqR has been tested) is
on the <a href="http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki">pqR wiki</a>.
You can see and report bugs at the <a
href="http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/issues">pqR issues page</A>.

<P>I am writing a series of posts discussing pqR on my blog, at <a
href="http://radfordneal.wordpress.com">radfordneal.wordpress.com</A>.
These posts refer to a set of speed tests for R that are available
<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/R-speed.html">here</a>.

<P>The git repository for the source code and development history of
pqR is at <a href="http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR">
http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR</a>.  The current release is on
branch Release-2013-07-19.  See the MODS file in that branch (or mods
directory in development branches) for information on how branches in
the git repository are organized.  These branches also document how
pqR differs from R-2.15.0.
