<h1>pqR - a pretty quick version of R</h1>

<P>pqR is a new version of the R interpreter.  It is based on
R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but improves on it in many
ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by implementing some new
features and fixing some bugs.

<P>One notable improvement is that for systems with multiple
processors or processor cores, pqR is able to do some numeric
computations in parallel with other operations of the interpreter, and
with other numeric computations.  

<P>The git repository for the source code and development history of
pqR is at <a href="http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR">
http://github.com/radfordneal/pqR</a>.  The initial public release is
on branch Release-2013-05-31.
